A full-stack project management software using node.js, express, react and postgresql

With this project, I:
•	Developed a full-stack project management software using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, integrating databases to handle real-time project data and user interactions.
•	Implemented dark mode, drag-and-drop functionality, Gantt charts, and interactive timelines to enhance user experience and streamline project tracking and management.
•	Created mock user functionality and dynamic tables to simulate project team collaboration, allowing for realistic testing and feedback in the management software.
